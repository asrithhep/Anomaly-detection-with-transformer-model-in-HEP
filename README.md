# ðŸ§  Anomaly Detection with Transformer Model in High-Energy Physics (HEP)

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning-driven analysis pipeline designed to enhance the discovery potential in High-Energy Physics (HEP) using **ATLAS Run-2 Open Data (2015â€“2016)**.

The goal is to preprocess ATLAS collision data and apply a **Transformer-based unsupervised anomaly detection model** to identify rare or Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics events hidden within large Standard Model backgrounds.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

- **Data Source:** ATLAS Open Data (Run 2, 2015â€“2016) in PhysLite `.root` format  
- **Processing Tools:** ROOT with Dask for scalable parallel data processing  
- **ML Model:** TabTransformer architecture tailored for tabular HEP data  
- **Objective:** Train on Standard Model background only, detect anomalies as events with high reconstruction loss  
- **Features:** Uses low-level physics variables such as jet/lepton kinematics, missing transverse energy, calorimeter deposits, and event topology  
- **Output:** Structured datasets (`.csv`, `.h5`) ready for anomaly detection downstream tasks
