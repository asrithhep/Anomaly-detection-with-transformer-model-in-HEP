# Anomaly-detection-with-transformer-model-in-HEP
Unsupervised anomaly detection has become a pivotal technique for model-independent searches for new physics at the LHC. In high-energy physics (HEP), anomaly detection is employed to identify rare, outlier events in collision data that deviate significantly from expected distributions.
